# Autocommit GitHub Changes

This GitHub Action allows you to commit changes to a Git repository within a GitHub Actions runner. You can commit directly to a branch, create a pull request, or even automate merging and cleanup.

<b><i>This action is managed by a private repository.</i></b>

## Usage

You can easily integrate this action into your workflow by adding it to your GitHub Actions configuration. Hereâ€™s an example:

```yaml
name: Autocommit Changes

on: [push]

jobs:
  autocommit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        
      - name: Autocommit Changes
        uses: kassett/autocommit-changes@v1
        with:
          branch: main
          use-pull-request: true
          merge-pull-request: false
          commit-message: "Committing changes automatically"
          pull-request-title: "Auto-commit PR"
          pull-request-body: "This PR was generated automatically by GitHub Actions."
          delete-branch-after-merge: true
```

One important thing to note is that this action should never run on a branch that has a detached HEAD; therefore, 
when using this action in a workflow invoked on `pull_request`, the workflow should checkout to the feature-branch.
Below is an example:

```yaml
name: Autocommit Changes

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  autocommit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
        
      - name: Autocommit Changes
        uses: kassett/autocommit-changes@v1
        with:
          branch: ${{ github.head_ref }}
```
